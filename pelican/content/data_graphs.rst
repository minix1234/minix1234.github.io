:summary: Interactive Plotly graphs that align covid-19 case data.

Below I have included an interactive graph that aligns the case data around the nearest "100th" cases as day 0 for that country.

Interestingly our household is predicting that around day 14-16 we will see the curve flatten out.  
Our hypothesis is that the number of cases will continue to increase after the emergency orders and 
business shutdowns due to the internal momentum of viral contractions and the required time to show symptoms.

You can see the rate of change for Canada starts to dampen out around day 14. All similar trajectories to South, Korea 
which also when on nation wide business shutdowns and lockdowns.
